	addonDescription	"A patch for Dead Air's Terminals, which does something you couldn't expect.. *drumroll* no gauntlet event! woohoo! give me the fanfare I've been waiting for!
	
	Summary of changes:
	- Metal Detector event is a Holdout.
	- Triggers follow the van, only pushing (or killing) things near the van's model. 
	- Nav mesh touch-ups with attribute flavouring to have no boss infecteds spawn near the event.
	- Areas barren of loot spawners are now populated."
