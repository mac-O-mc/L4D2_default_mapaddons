	addonDescription	"A patch for Dead Air, which.. *drumroll* removes the gauntlet event! woohoo! give me the fanfare I've been waiting for!

	- Metal Detector event is a Holdout.
	- Triggers follow the van, only pushing (or killing) things near its model. 
	- Nav mesh touch-ups with attribute flavouring to have no infecteds spawn near the event.
	- Areas barren of loot are now populated.
	
	Heads-up, c11m4_terminals.nav may conflict."
